    "- training set is the data used to develop models\n",
    "- test set or validation sets are used for evaluating the performance of a final set of candidate models.  \n",
    "- The predictors, independent variables, attributes, or discriptors are the data used to input for the prediction equation\n",
    "- Outcome, dependent variable, target, class, response refer to the outcome event or quantity that is being predicted.\n",
    "- Continuous data have natural, numeric scales (ex. Blood pressure, airplane altitute)\n",
    "- Categorial data, nomila, attribute, or discrete data take on specific values that have no scale (Good or bad credit score, stages of cancer.)\n",
    "- Model building, model training, parameter estimation refer to the process of using data to determine the value of model equations."
